# Kinect Arduino Car #

## Summary ##

For the ES50 course in college, I created a Kinect application that accepts natural user input (ie, motion and voice input), parses the input into commands, and forwards the commands to a Arduino-powered car wirelessly.

## Description ##

I took an introductory electrical engineering class called [ES50](https://www.facebook.com/EngSci50){:target="_blank"} in the spring of my junior year.  I really enjoyed it, and it got me interested in using [Arduinos](http://arduino.cc){:target="_blank"} to automate things in real life, not just in the digital world.  In fact, the end result of the class can be seen in this video:

My final project for the class ended up being a lot heavier on the software side of things though.  I ended up designing and creating a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/kinect" target="_blank">Kinect</a> application that took in motion input and/or voice input, parsed the input into commands, and sent those commands over a wireless [Xbee](http://digi.com/xbee){:target="_blank"} connection to an Arduino-powered robotic car. 

The application has 3 "modes" which are basically 3 different ways to give motion input to the car. The application supports voice input for both controlling the car and navigating the application.
